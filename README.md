# 📰 Fake News Detection - NLP & Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Fake News Detection** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. The goal is to classify news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**.

✅ **Live Demo**: [Insert your deployed Streamlit link here]
